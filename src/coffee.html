        <h1>Coffee</h1>

        <div>
            We work with specialty coffee from current crops which is carefully roasted. Our coffee is fruity, juicy
            and
            never boring. We bring you the best from leading european specialty roasteries, currently mostly from
            <a href="https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/">Square Mile Coffee Roasters</a>
            , a multi award winning coffee roasting company based in East London.

                            Fruity redcurrant and sweet honeysuckle flavours. An incredibly juicy coffee which we
                            struggled to decide on the right berry descriptor, but raspberry, blackberry and
                            blueberry
                            were also in the running!

                            delicious
                            creamy mouthfeel making this a tasty summer Ethiopian, hot or cold.
